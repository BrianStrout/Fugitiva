This purpose of building this site was built to find a free,
                  no-app, easy way to provide a restraurant's updated menu to
                  it's costumers. Post Covid-19, a lot of restraurants returned
                  with digital menus, however I noticed that a lot of them
                  featured pdfs, which made changes really annoying for
                  waitstaff to keep up with. And assuming with that most belts
                  were being tighted in the hospitality business, I wanted to
                  build a site that dynamically builds and updates it's menu
                  with reload items, prices, and descriptions. This is only
                  using a template I built and data from Google Sheets. This
                  would enable a manager to update the price on the spreadsheet
                  from their phone and have it immediately affect how it is
                  displayed in the menu. This site was built with HTML, CSS, and
                  Vanilla Javascript as well as an API for Google Sheets. I used
                  a real menu and information from a restaurant I like in
                  Lisbon.
